This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#For this assignment I analyzed the provided data to determine what activity an individual perform. To do this I made use of caret and randomForest, this allowed me to generate correct answers for each of the 20 test data cases provided in this assignment. I made use of a seed value for consistent results.
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
set.seed(12345)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Load Data
#First, I loaded the data both from the provided training and test data provided by COURSERA. Some values contained a "#DIV/0!" that I replaced with an NA value
myTraining <- read.csv("D:\\ML\\PracticalML\\w4\\pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv("D:\\ML\\PracticalML\\w4\\pml-testing.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))


#Clean data
#1. clean near zero variables
myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
myTraining <- myTraining[, !myDataNZV$nzv]
dim(myTraining)
#2. Remove variables with more than 80% of NAs
na_var <- sapply(colnames(myTraining),
                 function(x){
                   if(sum(is.na(myTraining[,x]))> 0.8 * nrow(myTraining))
                   {
                     return (T)
                   }
                   else
                   {
                     return (F)
                   }
                 })

myTraining <- myTraining[,!na_var]
#To check the new number of observations
dim(myTraining)
# Calculate correlations
cor <- abs(sapply(colnames(myTraining[, -ncol(myTraining)]), function(x) cor(as.numeric(myTraining[, x]), as.numeric(myTraining$classe), method = "spearman")))


#Plot
summary(cor)
plot(myTraining[, names(which.max(cor))], myTraining[, names(which.max(cor[-which.max(cor)]))], col = myTraining$classe, pch = 19, cex = 0.1, xlab = names(which.max(cor)), ylab = names(which.max(cor[-which.max(cor)])))

# A random forest model is applied on the data with a cross validation of 10
# This model building using random forest was very slow
rfFit <- train(classe ~ ., method = "rf", data = myTraining, importance = T, trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10))

imp <- varImp(rfFit)$importance
imp$max <- apply(imp, 1, max)
imp <- imp[order(imp$max, decreasing = T), ]


# final model
rfFit$finalModel
# prediction
(prediction <- as.character(predict(rfFit, testing)))

# Conclusions and Test Data Submit
# write prediction files
#Prepare the submission. (using COURSERA provided code)
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("./prediction/problem_id_", i, ".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(prediction)
```
